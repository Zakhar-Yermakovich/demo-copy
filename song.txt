You think that I can't live without your love?
You'll see
You think I can't go on another day?
You think I have nothing
Without you by my side?
You'll see, somehow, someway
You think that I can never laugh again?
You'll see
You think that you've destroyed my faith in love?
You think after all you've done
I'll never find my way back home?
You'll see, somehow, someday
